# One-Year-Later-Rebirth
1YL3D started off its journey in 2015 as a gamemode by a P3D Forum user known as Shou Liengod. It contained an original story, characters new and old, custom sprites and music and, of course, the beloved new starters - the golden and silver Eevee. The gamemode received steady and multiple updates before ultimately being abandoned 5 years ago, in 2017.
One Year Later: Rebirth is a direct continuation of the original gamemode maintained and nurtured as my own by me, Runaryu/agravedigger. I strive to carry the story on and keep the gamemode up with the latest P3D updates. I will attempt to pick up the pieces of the puzzle left in the original and try to put them together into an intense, interesting and meaningful story full of twists and danger!

If you are by any chance reading this, Shou, I would love to hear your opinion about what I did with your gamemode. If you do not agree with me continuing this gamemode, feel free to contact me and I'll take it down.
