@Text:Noel: <playername>...*I found out what's going on...*Just a year ago, there was~a vile organization~in Johto and Kanto...
@Text:<playername>: You mean...
@Text:Noel: Yeah...~But I believe it's much~worse than last year.*I can't say for sure,~since I wasn't in Johto last~year, so all I know is that~Team Rocket was taken down~by a single kid.
@Text:Noel: But now that the kid~has vanished, Johto isn't~what it used to be.*What's worse, this new~organization could be much~worse than Team Rocket.*Whatever the case is, we~need to put an end to them.
@Text:<playername>: Right.
@Text:Noel: I've heard rumors that~the organization was spotted~south of Violet City.
@Text:<playername>: We should~start our search there then.
@Text:Noel: I agree.*Although, I'll sit around~here for a while. I'm beat,~I've been running~around nonstop...
@Text:<playername>: Right.~I'll go do what~I have to do.
@Text:Noel: Good luck, <playername>!
@Text:<playername>: Good luck~to you too!
