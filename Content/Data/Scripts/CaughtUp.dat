@Text:Eliza: I found some neat info!
@Move:101,3
@Text:<player.name>: What did~you find out?
@Text:Eliza: I saw a red-haired man~talking to himself near the~lab on Route 30.
@Text:Eliza: The man mentioned that~these grunts have special~access. Perhaps to their base?
@Text:<player.name>:Access?
@Text:Eliza: But that's not all.*He said that their DNA~itself provides access.
@Text:<player.name>: Interesting info,~but it doesn't help a lot~currently. If we were to find~out where they are hiding~though... All we'd need is~a grunt and we're in.
@Text:Eliza: Exactly!
@Text:<player.name>: Did you find~out anything else?
@Text:Eliza: Well...~I couldn't because I was~caught, so I had to~run away...
@Text:<player.name>: What you found~out will definitely help~us in the future though.
@Text:Eliza: I'm glad!
@Text:<player.name>: For now,~we need to head for Goldenrod!
@Text:Eliza: Yes!*But...
@Text:<player.name>: But..?
@Text:Eliza: ...*Route 32 is blocked off.

@Text:Eliza: This is the HM Cut.~I found it near the~ponds of Cherrygrove.
@Text:<player.name>: Cool!~I'm not following though...
@Text:Eliza: First, look at this map.
@Text:(Eliza showed you the map)
@Action:TOWNMAP,johto
@Text:Eliza: You see how you can~access Goldenrod via two~directions? There's a tree~blocking Route 36, but now~that we have this HM...
@Text:<player.name>: I see...
@Text:Eliza: We can either go~directly to Goldenrod~or we can take a detour~to Ecruteak.
@Text:Eliza: Though, I want to~go to Ecruteak.~I heard it's a calm~and beautiful place!*It'll be a good chance~to go sightseeing!*Who knows?~We might find more~about the Neon!*I'd love it if you could~come with me...*Unless you have to~go to Goldenrod first...
@Text:<player.name>: I don't know...*Reaching Goldenrod should~be my priority.
@Text:Eliza: Right.*Whatever you decide,~it'll still be a win-win!*I'll go on ahead!
@Text:<player.name>: I'll catch you later!
