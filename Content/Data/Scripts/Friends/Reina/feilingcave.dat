@Text:<playername>: I'm sorry!~Were you waiting for long?
@Text:Reina: No, I just arrived!
@Text:<playername>: That's good.*So...*A teacher, huh?*Reina: Hehe, yeah.~I became a teacher after I~finished my Pokémon training.*It's hard to believe it's~been 2 years...*<playername>: Really?~Sounds like you're just~slightly older than me.*Reina: Oh, really?~How old are you?*<playername>: I just turned 17~a month ago.*Reina: Hehe, I'm older by one!*<playername>: Well then, miss...
@Text:Reina: I'm just teasing a bit!*<playername>: Right. Anyway...~About my verification...
@Text:Reina: Right, we still~have to do that, huh?*Here's how that goes...*I will talk about a couple~of things related to the~verification process.*Will that be alright?
@Text:<playername>: Yes!
@Text:Reina: Alright...*Let's see...

@Bulb:1|20|0.9|8
@Text:Ah!
@Music:lakeside
@Text:Okay, here's the deal.~I will talk about two topics~and after that,~we'll have a test battle.~I'm sure these may be things~you already know,~but that's how regulations~are anyway.
@Text:Now then, let's begin.
@Sound:Save
@Text:Firstly: Weaknesses!
@Text:As you may know, the best~offense is the best defense!
@Text:Let me explain.*I'm sure you are well~acquainted with typings.*Patience and strategy are~very important!*It's never a good idea~to rush a fight.*Increasing your defense~creates a sort of... barrier,~if you will.*It will you provide with~enough opportunities and~time to find weaknesses~and strike efficiently.
@Text:Here's an example!*Let's say your adorable Eevee~is fighting against a~Fighting type.*You would want to use Eevee's~Sand Attack and Growl~to minimize incoming damage.*Of course, it's risky,~but it might be worth~it in the end.*Switching to a, let's say,~Ghost type would bring you~to an advantage as well.*Ultimately, the strategy~you will use is up to you.
@Sound:Save
@Text:Secondly: Effort Values!
@Text:Of course, raising specific~stats is usually better~than simply levelling up.
@Text:A high level Pokémon that~wasn't properly trained~will lose against a~well-trained Pokémon!
@Text:Effort Values, or EVs, are~bonus stats earned through~constant training with~specific kinds of Pokémon.
@Text:Here's an example. Many~Flying types yield bonus~speed stats.*If training sounds a bit too~overwhelming, there are also~items that boost EVs, such~as so-called Feathers.~Be sure to keep an eye out~for those.*However, there are also~Individual Values which vary~from Pokémon to Pokémon.~Every Pokémon is powerful~in its own way, so be sure~to catch as many as you can~to find the one best suited~for you!
@Text:And that's all for today!
@Bulb:8|20|0.9|8
@Wait:30
@Music:nomusic
@Text:Reina: That's about it~regarding lectures.*Now all that's left is a~test battle!*However, if you don't feel~like you're ready yet,~I'll give you some time to~train up a bit more.*Until then, I'll be waiting~right here.
